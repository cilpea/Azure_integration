Azure Container Apps ARM and YAML template specifications
In this article

    API versions

    Container app
    Container Apps job

Azure Container Apps deployments are powered by an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. Some Container Apps CLI commands also support using a YAML template to specify a resource.

This article includes examples of the ARM and YAML configurations for frequently used Container Apps resources. For a complete list of Container Apps resources see Azure Resource Manager templates for Container Apps. The code listed in this article is for example purposes only. For full schema and type information, see the JSON definitions for your required API version.
API versions

Check the latest stable and preview API versions in the Resource Manager API documentation to ensure you're using the most up-to-date versions.

To learn more about the differences between API versions, see Microsoft.App change log.
Updating API versions

To use a specific API version in ARM or Bicep, update the version referenced in your templates. To use the latest API version in Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell, update them to the latest version.

Update Azure CLI and the Azure Container Apps extension by running the following commands:
Bash

az upgrade
az extension add -n containerapp --upgrade

To update Azure PowerShell, see How to install Azure PowerShell.

To programmatically manage Azure Container Apps with the latest API version, use the latest versions of the management SDK:

    .NET
    Go
    Java
    Node.js
    Python

Container Apps environment

The following tables describe commonly used properties available in the Container Apps environment resource. For a complete list of properties, see Azure Container Apps REST API reference.
Resource

A Container Apps environment resource includes the following properties:
Property 	Description 	Data type 	Read only
daprAIInstrumentationKey 	The Application Insights instrumentation key used by Dapr. 	string 	No
appLogsConfiguration 	The environment's logging configuration. 	Object 	No
peerAuthentication 	How to enable mTLS encryption. 	Object 	No
Examples

The following example ARM template snippet deploys a Container Apps environment.

Note

The commands to create container app environments don't support YAML configuration input.

Container app

The following tables describe the commonly used properties in the container app resource. For a complete list of properties, see Azure Container Apps REST API reference.
Resource

A container app configuration includes a top-level kind property, which is an optional string used to create either a Functions or workflow app.
Property 	Description 	Data type 	Read only
kind 	The kind of app to create. Currently supports functionapp and workflowapp. Additional values may be supported in the future. If omitted, a standard container app is created by default. 	string 	No

A container app resource's properties object includes the following properties:
Property 	Description 	Data type 	Read only
provisioningState 	The state of a long running operation, for example when new container revision is created. Possible values include: provisioning, provisioned, failed. Check if app is up and running. 	string 	Yes
environmentId 	The environment ID for your container app. This is a required property to create a container app. If you're using YAML, you can specify the environment ID using the --environment option in the Azure CLI instead. 	string 	No
latestRevisionName 	The name of the latest revision. 	string 	Yes
latestRevisionFqdn 	The latest revision's URL. 	string 	Yes

The environmentId value takes the following form:
Console

/subscriptions/<SUBSCRIPTION_ID>/resourcegroups/<RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME>/providers/Microsoft.App/environmentId/<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>

In this example, you put your values in place of the placeholder tokens surrounded by <> brackets.
properties.configuration

A resource's properties.configuration object includes the following properties:
Property 	Description 	Data type
activeRevisionsMode 	Setting to single automatically deactivates old revisions, and only keeps the latest revision active. Setting to multiple allows you to maintain multiple revisions. 	string
secrets 	Defines secret values in your container app. 	object
ingress 	Object that defines public accessibility configuration of a container app. 	object
registries 	Configuration object that references credentials for private container registries. Entries defined with secretref reference the secrets configuration object. 	object
dapr 	Configuration object that defines the Dapr settings for the container app. 	object

Changes made to the configuration section are application-scope changes, which doesn't trigger a new revision.
properties.template

A resource's properties.template object includes the following properties:
Property 	Description 	Data type
revisionSuffix 	A friendly name for a revision. This value must be unique as the runtime rejects any conflicts with existing revision name suffix values. 	string
containers 	Configuration object that defines what container images are included in the container app. 	object
scale 	Configuration object that defines scale rules for the container app. 	object

Changes made to the template section are revision-scope changes, which triggers a new revision.
Examples

For details on health probes, refer to Health probes in Azure Container Apps.

    ARM template
    YAML

The following example YAML configuration deploys a container app when used with the --yaml parameter in the following Azure CLI commands:

    az containerapp create
    az containerapp update
    az containerapp revision copy

The following example YAML shows how to deploy a container app.
